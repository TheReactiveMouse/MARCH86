    Dear Developer, I want to say something special to you. Is just an empty project, you have to create manually everything that is you needed to build your MFS Image.

    Just you should know this thing.

    0x8000 - Signature to end loop.
    FF2ZS6ZT29YXOFYDMWJVLO6YWS53IXEJGOQ0FGNUQALYCPME06 - Signature that indicates the end of OS memory.
    72 - Address where should be a pointer to your bootloader or kernel.

    By default, the library dedicates 512 Bytes of Memory, but you can dedicate as much memory as your system possibles.

    Good Luck, Mr. TheReactiveMouse.
    Official Developer of mouseWorld and all MARCH Processors.
